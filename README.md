Alcohol Calculator for Beer and Other Drinks
============================================

In the US, a "drink" is considered to be 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, which approximately translates into [12oz of 5% beer](http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/whatcountsdrink/whatsastandarddrink.asp). But what if you have a 22oz beer with 6.2% alcohol or two 20oz beers at 8% alcohol? This can be dangerous. I wanted a quick way to check.
